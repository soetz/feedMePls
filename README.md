# FEED ME PlayLiSts
JS audio/video RSS feed player, designed for podcast

You can use it directly on [my site](http://feedmepls.soetz.fr).

## Usage

You can enter a RSS feed URL in the field at the top left of the webpage, and the corresponding channel is directly added to the channels list, on the left of the page. You can then click on it to choose it, and select an item (typically, a podcast) from the ones that appear on the right side of the screen.

When selected, an item plays automatically. You can pause, replay the last 10 seconds, fast-forward 10 seconds, play the previous item, play the next item and go to fullscreen mode. There's also a progress bar that you can use to jump to anywhere in your item.

Oh, and your feeds list is automatically saved to the local storage of your browser, so don't worry, you won't have to search for your feeds again.
